Deliverable 1
Kaushal - 1.1. Background: You need to introduce your client and explain the context of your project including your end-users. (10 points)
 Our client is an SJSU student who, like other students, faces financial challenges due to tuition fees, rent, books, and other personal expenses. Managing finances effectively is crucial for students to maintain financial stability while having other educational and social responsibilities 

Kaushal -1.2. Problem Statement: The need for your system should be identified and justified with concrete evidence. Discuss (a) how the need/opportunity was recognized; (b) the magnitude of the need/opportunity; and (c) the contributing (internal and external) factors to the need. (20 points)

	The need for an expense tracking system for SJSU students is justified through discussions on common financial challenges such as high tuition costs, expensive housing, and the lack of budgeting skills. Many students face financial stress due to limited income, irresponsible expenses, and other economic pressures, making it difficult for students to manage essential costs effectively. The magnitude of this need is significant as many students struggle with money management, leading to overspending, debt, or a missed opportunity to save money. Some internal factors include challenges like psychological needs and limited financial literacy. Some external factors would be rising tuition, high living costs, and spending pressures. So, by providing students with our budgeting tool, our application will aim to help students track expenses, reduce financial stress, and develop better money-spending habits.
